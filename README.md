# Codestrong 2012

The [Codestrong 2012](http://www.codestrong.com) conference application was created using Titanium Mobile
and the brand-spanking new MVC framework, Alloy, which was written on top of it to enhance developer productivity.

This app (and Alloy) still have quite a way to go.  If you're looking for the 2011 version using plain ol' JS,
there is a tag for that version downloadable in this repository.

This application and the associated source code are released under the Apache 2.0 open source license.  Code strong!
