This session introduces, through concrete examples, the advantages provided by the use of database abstraction tools.
It will list the available javascript ORMs on the market, depicting their differences, and will focus on joli.js, the lightweight still complete ORM published by the speaker. The attendees will learn how to take the best out of this ORM, will be taught about its useful querying model, and will learn how to extend it.
As a conclusion, a simple web services consumer extension of joli.js will be presented, which allows to consume web services and put their responses in a database through the very same API as joli.js.

JSS makes Titanium mobile development more declarative and easier to make design changes. The speaker, author of an upcoming book on Sass, will show you how to create JSS files using  and even reusable patterns across your mobile projects. Attendees will walk away knowing how to:

Organize stylesheet sources in multiple files and compile one or many JSS assets
Use variables, partials, and mixins to write less code to generate the same JSS
Bundle patterns to reuse or share with others using Compass
