    <h2>About this application</h2>
    <p>The CODESTRONG mobile application lets you view session schedules,
      descriptions, maps, and presenter bios from the palm of your hand, as well
      as live updates from the official Appcelerator Twitter feed.  The CODESTRONG
      mobile application for iOS and Android was developed by the Appcelerator Developer
      Relations team using the Appcelerator Titanium mobile framework.</p>
      
    <p>It was built based off of work done by the development team at Palantir.net which consisted of:
      	<ul>
      		<li>Larry Garfield (Lead)</li>
      		<li>Pat Teglia (Developer)</li>
      		<li>Jen Simmons (Designer)</li>
      	</ul>
    </p>

    	Public License, version 3 or, at your option, any later version.</p>
